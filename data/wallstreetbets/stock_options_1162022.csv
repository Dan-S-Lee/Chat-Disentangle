Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith","",""

When GameStop dropped to $40 and there was a Congressional hearing, nobody had any support other than blind faith in DFV.

Nobody knew if he was still holding, UUSB had been compromised, there was no Superstonk, no Documentaries, or Jon Stewart ""The Problem"" Episodes.  No years of DD on how the market actually works via loopholes that benefit Market Makers and Hedge Funds.  

GameStop had not solved their financial situation and Media was promoting ""Shorts Closed"", ""Melvin closed their GameStop Position"", ""Sell now, ask questions later"".

People who bought into the GameStop sneeze, and were holding, had nothing but brass balls, faith, and a vague awareness that they weren't alone.

Now, the Retail Investor Community has grown massively, lots of people from GameStop are in Bed Bath & Beyond, and that experience is making the current price movements a complete non-issue for them.  Some, like myself are beside themselves that shares can still be purchased at current prices.

So, for the first timers visiting the sub, or for those inexperienced to the way this game is played, just know that for every moment of fear you may encounter, there are thousands of other Retail Investors smirking at the price and buying more.","","kekw (1)"

This is the kind of advice you need right now in this bear market. I don't worship God, I worship the almighty greenback. I have more faith in the average ticket price of McDonalds drive thru guests than I do mostly everything else in my life. I have seen people with $5000 in their bank accounts take out absurd loans just to drive a 2017 dodge challenger down the street and be arrested 30 minutes later for possession. There is no limit to the brazen, psychotic mentality that is the stoking fire of American capitalism. Our thots will shake their dirty sweaty asses for HOURS to make that rent. Have you ever seen a gamer wagie finish his third shift, sip that mt dew champ, you're poor and thriving. America is a nation that will manufacture airline components incorrectly just to shave a marginal cost, putting the lives of hundreds of thousands at risk.

"608746780942925844","Bobby Fischer#6938","11-Oct-22 10:21 PM","Imagine that your entire life you've always been the alpha. You're 6'2, top of your class, gifted, brilliant. You're a real hot shot, a go getter. So you join the military, the air force, you graduate from the air force academy, top of your class, best dog fighter in your outfit, a leader, teacher, warrior, humble American servant. You become an F35 pilot. You are the epitome of dominance, on the land, in relationships, you command a room, and you treat the sky like you are a hawk. Your technology is superior to foreign crap, to them you are a phantom killer. No predators, only mice. Dashing, resilient, deadly. You own the skies. But one day, you get a funny feeling. You begin to have thoughts, feelings that something is watching you, an overwhelming, nauseating fear like something is behind you, even inside your cock pit. All of a sudden you hear a voice say your name and then immediately a 40ft, black cube is suspended in front of your aircraft, traveling in unison with you, only to suddenly vanish. In a frantic, screaming call you radio for your squadron to form up., but after 30 seconds of flying in formation, 4 black cubes fly right between you traveling in the opposite direction. Panic, yelling, confusion, chaos. You begin to remember videos on National Geographic of killer whales flinging their prey into the air. You are in a pile of metal hurling at 2000mph being accelerated by a controlled explosion, all around you is a fire hazard. You're no more stealth than the moon in the sky. You're not a predator, you're stupid grazing wildlife. You're barely flying, more akin to a controlled plummet. Slow, brittle, exposed. You are not the big dog anymore, and now every single time you go out to fly, you know they are up there.","","weirdkekw (1)"
